                        <p>
                            Channels and pores are important regions of proteins and other biomacromolecules. They connect internal spaces of biomacromolecules with exterior enabling, e.g.,
                            substrates/product transport towards enzymesâ€™ active sites, nascent synthetized proteins to leave ribosomal proteosynthetic center via ribosomal exit channel, etc. 
                            Pores represent a pathway passing through the whole biomacromolecular structure, typically facilitating transport of ions or molecules through cellular biomembranes.                    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Channel walls are made from surrounding amino acids constituting a specific microenvironment, which influence to a great extent specificity and selectivity of plethora
                            biologically important processes. Their constitution is especially important in narrowing sites sych as local minimas and bottlenecks.
